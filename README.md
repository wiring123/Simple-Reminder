# Simple-Reminder
Version 2.3

Simple Reminder is an advanced VB project built by wiring123 on Github. The user is able to set the timer to go off on the exact second that is required. It isn't ever a second off* This application is ideal for remembering things that have deadlines. (i.e. Screen time limit, project due soon alarm, etc.)




*Simple Reminder is only accurate to you computer's clock. If your computer's clock is not set correctly, the timer will not go off at the correct time.
